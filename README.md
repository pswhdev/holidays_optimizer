The "Holidays Optimizer" is a user-friendly program designed to help the user make the most out of their vacation days. It cleverly identifies public holidays within a given time frame and suggests the best days to take off from work. This way, regular holidays can be extended into longer breaks. The program is especially useful to maximize time off without using up too many leave days. By aligning vacation with existing public holidays, and considering weekends, it helps to achieve longer periods of leisure.
