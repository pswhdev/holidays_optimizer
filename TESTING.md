## Validation

The code underwent validation using the Code Institute's Pep8 Linter with no errors detected. The validation result is provided below:

![PEP8 Validation Result](documentation/pep8-result.png)

Validation has been implemented for all user inputs after each entry, to ensure no dead ends for the user or acceptance of invalid user input.

Since the HTML and JavaScript were provided through a specific template rather than being created by me, I have not conducted validation for those.

## Manual Testing

User input validation was carried out throughout the project build to ensure any possible errors that can be made were caught and properly handled.

Since I decided to use the external holidays library in the program, even though the countries dictionary I incorporated into my database is up-to-date with the library, there's a possibility that in the future a country might be removed from the library's list or countries might split and change names, among other potential changes. Therefore, I added a fictional country to the list to be able to catch and handle the error that would arise in a future scenario where a country is present in the program's list but is no longer on the library's list. After implementing the function to check if the country is supported by the library and testing to ensure the program handled the error as expected, the country has been removed from the list.

To test the results given by the program, I randomly chose three countries: Germany (Bayern), Sweden and Bahamas with the start date of 01-01-2025 and end date 01-01-2026 and compared the results obtained with the program with a calendar generated by the [Time and Date](https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/) website to visualy compare the suggested dates.

I set the date range period to 366 days for a year instead of 365. This was done to make it easier for the user to plan for a full year, from the first day to the first day, and to account for leap years at the same time.

## Testing User Stories

- As a user, I want an attractive and engaging application.
    - Rich library used to produce text with engaging colours and meaning  
       - GREEN  for choice confirmation and result displays
       - YELLOW to highlight important information and draw the user's attention to it
       - RED for invalid input
       - CYAN to highlight the dates

- As a user, I want clear instructions provided throughout the application.
    - During the programs execution clear instructions are given every step of the way.

- As a user, I want feedback confirming my choices of country, state, and selected period.
    - After entering data, the user is prompted with a message confirming the input.
- As a user, I want to be able to re-enter data entered by mistake during the process without having to restart the program.
    - After each input, the user is prompted to confirm their choice and given the chance to re-enter a new option if desired.
- As a user, I want a clear and sorted output of the suggested vacation dates.
    - The final results of the program are displayed as a clear list of blocks of suggestions, presenting vacation days to be taken sorted by date.
