    # if there are two holidays during the given period --> best result is to use up to 2 days per holiday than take 4 days in one week. For instance using the logic described above, taking 2 days on a week with a holiday we have 5 days free. If we do it with two separate holidays we then have 10 days using 4 vacation days.
